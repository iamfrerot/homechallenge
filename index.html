     <h1>Fennec Fox</h1>
     <p>
      The Fennec Fox (Vulpes zerda) is a small nocturnal fox native to the
      deserts of North Africa, particularly the Sahara. Known for its large
      ears, which help dissipate heat and locate prey, the Fennec Fox is the
      smallest canid species, typically weighing around 1-1.5 kg. Its thick fur
      offers insulation against both cold nights and hot days. Fennec Foxes are
      omnivores, feeding on plants, insects, small mammals, and birds. They live
      in burrows and are highly social, often found in family groups. Their
      large ears also contribute to excellent hearing, aiding in hunting.
      Adapted to desert life, they can survive with minimal water, obtaining
      moisture from their food.

     <h1>Humpback Whale</h1>
     <p>
      The Humpback Whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is a large baleen whale known
      for its impressive acrobatics and complex songs. They can grow up to 16
      meters (52 feet) long and weigh around 30-40 tons. Humpback Whales are
      found in oceans worldwide, migrating between feeding grounds in polar
      regions and breeding grounds in tropical or subtropical waters. They feed
      primarily on krill and small fish, using a unique technique called bubble
      net feeding to corral their prey. Their songs, which can last up to 20
      minutes, are believed to play a role in communication and mating. Humpback
      Whales were once heavily hunted but have made a significant recovery due
      to international conservation efforts.

     <h1>Common Brown Baboon</h1>
     <p>
      The Common Brown Baboon, or Chacma Baboon (Papio ursinus), is a large
      primate native to southern Africa. They live in diverse environments like
      savannas and woodlands and are recognized by their dog-like faces and
      brown-grey fur. These social animals form troops of varying sizes and have
      complex social structures. Omnivorous, they eat fruits, seeds, insects,
      and small animals. Chacma Baboons are skilled climbers, often sleeping in
      trees or on cliffs. Human-wildlife conflict arises when they raid crops
      and garbage, making conservation efforts crucial for their coexistence
      with humans.

     <h1>Spotted Deer</h1>
     <p>
      The Spotted Deer, or Chital (Axis axis), is a medium-sized deer native to
      the Indian subcontinent. It has a reddish-brown coat with white spots and
      males have large, three-pronged antlers. They live in forests and
      grasslands, forming large herds. Spotted Deer primarily graze on grass but
      also eat leaves and fruits. Known for their agility and strong senses,
      they evade predators like tigers and leopards. Conservation efforts aim to
      protect their habitats and manage human-wildlife conflicts.
